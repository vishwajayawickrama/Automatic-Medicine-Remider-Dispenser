## Introduction

Modern lifestyles have caused a widespread use of medication across different age groups. However, issues such as forgetfulness or negligence in adhering to correct dosage and timing pose significant risks. Failing to take medicine on time or in the right dose can have severe consequences, potentially leading to life-threatening situations. Therefore, addressing the challenges associated with medication adherence is crucial for ensuring the well-being and safety of individuals in our society.

### Problem in Brief

The challenge addressed by this medicine dispenser and reminder system revolves around the common issue of medication non-adherence. In today's fast-paced lifestyle, individuals often face difficulties in consistently taking their prescribed medications at the right time and in the correct doses. This prevalent problem can lead to serious health consequences, as missed doses or incorrect medication intake may compromise the effectiveness of treatments. This system aims to mitigate these challenges by introducing a reliable and automated approach to medication adherence, ultimately seeking to enhance overall health outcomes and alleviate the stress associated with medication management for both users and caregivers.

### Significance of Study

The medicine reminder and dispenser system is of paramount importance as it directly addresses the critical issue of medication adherence. This system makes life easier for patients and reduces the stress on their caregivers by providing the right dose of medicine at the right time. It includes a feature allowing users to obtain the required medication when needed. Furthermore, the system provides users with the capability to verify the type and dosage of their medication. To ensure user acknowledgment, the system sends notifications and activates alarms upon dispensing, confirming that the user has received and acknowledged the medicine.

### Aim and Objectives

**Aim:**

The objective of this project is to help people maintain their health by using modern technology to guide people to take medicines at the right time and prevent life-threats caused by wrong dosage.

**Objectives:**

- Mitigated risk through the implementation of a covered pill dispensing mechanism, elevating the safety and security of medication management.
- Saves time for users by automating the medication management process, reducing the need for manual tracking and administration.
- Users can verify the type and dosage of their medications, promoting awareness and understanding of their treatment plans.
- Ability to get medication even on user input in addition to the scheduled time to get medication.
- Minimizes the risk of health complications resulting from inconsistent or incorrect medication intake, improving overall patient health.
- Facilitates remote monitoring of medication adherence, allowing caregivers or healthcare providers to track and support users from a distance.
- Provides valuable data on medication adherence patterns, allowing healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and adjustments to treatment plans.

## Literature Study

There are a large variety of medication administration assistance devices for non-professional users. Most devices are not very user-friendly, and some proposed systems do not work without the internet and none of them focused on the physically disabled patients. Most of them are manual, providing multiple compartments called pill trays. The pill tray has several compartments that can be filled with medication. Each compartment can hold different sizes and combinations of medicines. The user is required to take medicine from each tray each day for a maximum of 28 days. It does not provide any alarm to indicate the time of taking the medicine. This medication reminder and dispenser is a gadget that uses both visual and audible signals to remind the user. It reminds at a pre-set time to take medicines or attend certain events. If the user prefers, this device could provide medicine out of the schedule without the internet. A Web application is designed to help patients to avoid mistakes. It reminds its users to take the correct medicines on time and record the intake schedules for later review by healthcare professionals.

## Proposed Solution

Our proposed dispensing system can accept pre-set times and doses for up to five different medicines, alerting patients when it's time to take each medicine. The dispensing system can issue the required medicines at the designated times. In our dispensing system, medicines do not come into contact with each other, ensuring safety by preventing interactions between different medicines or the same medicines. Medicines can be stored within their original covers for added safety.

### Features of the Proposed Solution

- **Automatic Medicine Dispensing System**: This dispenser can dispense up to 5 different pre-set doses of medicine.
- **Schedule Management**: This can notify and alarm patients in a pre-set timetable to take medicine.
- **Alarm and Notifications**: Sends notifications to the phone and sets an alarm until the patient takes their medicine.
- **Override Schedule and Get Custom Medicines**: If a patient wishes to take a custom medication outside of the prescribed regimen, they can manually select the medicine and its quantity, obtaining the medication by overriding the schedule.
- **Refill Indicator**: This will remind you when a certain medicine is running out, prompting the need for a refill.
- **Backup Battery Power**: This can operate during power outages, ensuring uninterrupted functionality with its battery power.

### Nature of the Solution

The solution involves using various components to create an automated system that can manage medicine schedules and dispense them accordingly. The block diagram below shows the input, process, and output flow of the system.
